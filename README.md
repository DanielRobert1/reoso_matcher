# Getting started

## Installation

Installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 

Clone the repository

    git clone git@github.com:DanielRobert1/reoso_matcher.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd reoso_matcher

Install all the dependencies using composer

    composer install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Start the local development server

    php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

**TL;DR command list**

    git clone git@github.com:DanielRobert1/reoso_matcher.git
    cd reoso_matcher
    composer install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    
**Make sure you set the correct database connection information before running the migrations** [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

    php artisan migrate
    php artisan serve

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes property_types, properties, search_profiles. This can help you to quickly start testing the api.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

The api can be accessed at [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api).
